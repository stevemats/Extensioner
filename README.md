# Extensioner

Extensioner is a simple program built in python that helps you with the ease of converting multiple images which are for the pourpose of .e.g. product upload or personal projects from one format to another format of your choice.(example might be png,jpg and other formats)

Things needed for this project:
  
  - Pillow Module
  - Image(s) needed to be converted
   [[NB: By default the Images should be in the same folder as resire.py if not modify to specify
       location. The code is in simple easy to understand and edit with a guide in form of comment.]]
  - A destination folder to store the converted images automatically to avoid mixing the converted with unconverted.
  - A smiling face {```}
